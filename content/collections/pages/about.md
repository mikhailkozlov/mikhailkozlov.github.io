Ever since school I've been designing, building and implementing all sorts of SMB automation tools and systems. 
For that past 16 years I'm involved with CRM, ERP, and marketing automation as Architect and Team Lead on Internal Application team for one of the major CRM platforms.

Currently, I lead IT teams responsible for productivity tooling and corporate identity at an infrastructure-as-code company. 

### When not codding

When I'm not hitting keys on keyboard, I can be found [on the track 🏎](http://goo.gl/sdt8TQ) or at the local gym 💪.
