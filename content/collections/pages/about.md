Ever since school, I’ve been designing, building, and implementing a all sorts of automation tools and systems for small and medium-sized businesses.

For the past 21 years, I’ve worked with CRM, ERP, IAM, iPaaS, and other enterprise systems - driving automation across Marketing, HR, Sales, Finance, and R&D. I’ve served as an IT leader on several Internal Applications teams, including at a major CRM platform, the infrastructure-as-code company, and the Big Blue.

Currently, I lead software engineering teams within IT, focused on enterprise automation, productivity tooling, and corporate identity.
